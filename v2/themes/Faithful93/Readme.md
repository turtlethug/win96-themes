# Faithful93
### the only 93 theme you will ever need.
![Faithful93 Preview](https://github.com/turtlethug/win96-themes/tree/main/v2/themes/Faithful93/assets/preview.png)

### Preamble
Faithful93 was built for Windows 96 v2. v3 support will come once v3 itself comes.

Obviously, this theme isn't 100% accurate.

Design and assets all belong to Sys42 and the Windows 93 team over at [windows93.net](https://windows93.net). No infringement was intended!

If you have any improvments to the theme, feel free to make a pull request, and i'll add you to the credits at the end of this readme.

### Notes
For a 93 accurate explorer, set "showSidebar" to false in C:/system/config/explorer.json. The sidebar is themed if you want to leave it on though.

Because the default start menu is utter trash, I've included an alternate start menu that looks like the Windows 96 one. Just comment out the entirety of the default menu and uncomment the "comfortable" one.
